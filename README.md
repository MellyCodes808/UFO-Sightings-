# UFO-Sightings-
Overview of the analysis:

Results:

The Purpose of this project was to build a webpage displaying compiled information on UFOs and UFO sightings. An initial dataset was collected with details of the sightings in 2010. Dynamic filtering was utilized to enable users to quickly analyze through the data for their interest using filters. These filters include:
Date
City
State
Country
Shape
 
And additionally, comments on each report can be seen. 

To preform a search :

1 To the bottom left of the site summary, there is a table of all UFO sightings with filter options. By default, no filter options are added, thus all available data is displayed.

2 In the filter options, simply enter your criteria and click outside the text box to show results. Multiple criterion can be added and to delta filters just delete text.


Summary:

 One drawback is that this static file and any changes to the data will require a manual update to the data.js file. One way to make this a dynamic and updated site would be to add automated web scraping to add new sightings. Another drawback of this webpage is that it shows all the data at once-though It's nice to see the full data set, it is hard to identify trends. The site would be better if the data was summarized in map form to see where the highest frequency of sightings is. Furthermore, it would be great to see a Barchart of the shape and duration data. It would then be easier to identify outliers and drill-down into the data more with filters that way.
